# Scrapy Parser

Participated in the Hackathon in December 2023. My part of the code as a Backend developer was to write a parser in the Scrapy framework.
Which was implemented.

What to do to make it work:

Dependencies need to be installed (pip install -r requirements.txt)

Go to the news folder (cd news)

Enter the command (scrapy crawl spider) into the terminal

The result is written to a .csv file
